# ACME-Sports
The frontend was developed using React and Express was used for the backend.

## Instructions
- Run `npm install` within the frontend and backend directories to install required modules
- Run `npm start` within the frontend and backend directories to start the backend server on port 3001 and front end on port 3000
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Assumptions
- There will only ever be two Team Conferences (AFC and NFC)

## UI Features
- Filtering Teams by every attribute except ID
- Grouping Teams by Conference

Time constraints due to my current schedule didn't permit me to tune some features better.

## Limitations of the App and Code Base
- Hardcoded Conference Grouping Algorithm
- Fixed Grouping parameter (By Conferences only)
- UI could use some finesse
- Restricted sorting order
- The front-end components could be further modularized to allow for easier debuging
